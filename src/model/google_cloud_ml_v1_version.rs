	/// `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a model from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform model updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `GetVersion`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `UpdateVersion` to ensure that their change will be applied to the model as intended.
	pub etag: Option<String>,
	/// Optional. Cloud Storage paths (`gs://â€¦`) of packages for [custom prediction routines](/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/custom-prediction-routines) or [scikit-learn pipelines with custom code](/ml-engine/docs/scikit/exporting-for-prediction#custom-pipeline-code). For a custom prediction routine, one of these packages must contain your Predictor class (see [`predictionClass`](#Version.FIELDS.prediction_class)). Additionally, include any dependencies used by your Predictor or scikit-learn pipeline uses that are not already included in your selected [runtime version](/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/runtime-version-list). If you specify this field, you must also set [`runtimeVersion`](#Version.FIELDS.runtime_version) to 1.4 or greater.
	pub package_uris: Option<Vec<String>>,
	/// Optional. The machine learning framework AI Platform uses to train this version of the model. Valid values are `TENSORFLOW`, `SCIKIT_LEARN`, `XGBOOST`. If you do not specify a framework, AI Platform will analyze files in the deployment_uri to determine a framework. If you choose `SCIKIT_LEARN` or `XGBOOST`, you must also set the runtime version of the model to 1.4 or greater.

	pub explanation_config: Option<GoogleCloudMlV1__ExplanationConfig>,
	/// Optional. The type of machine on which to serve the model. Currently only applies to online prediction service. To learn about valid values for this field, read [Choosing a machine type for online prediction](/ai-platform/prediction/docs/machine-types-online-prediction). If this field is not specified and you are using a [regional endpoint](/ai-platform/prediction/docs/regional-endpoints), then the machine type defaults to `n1-standard-2`. If this field is not specified and you are using the global endpoint (`ml.googleapis.com`), then the machine type defaults to `mls1-c1-m2`.
	pub machine_type: Option<String>,

	/// Optional. Specifies paths on a custom container's HTTP server where AI Platform Prediction sends certain requests. If you specify this field, then you must also specify the `container` field. If you specify the `container` field and do not specify this field, it defaults to the following: ```json { "predict": "/v1/models/MODEL/versions/VERSION:predict", "health": "/v1/models/MODEL/versions/VERSION" } ``` See RouteMap for more details about these default values.
	pub routes: Option<GoogleCloudMlV1__RouteMap>,
	/// Optional. Specifies a custom container to use for serving predictions. If you specify this field, then `machineType` is required. If you specify this field, then `deploymentUri` is optional. If you specify this field, then you must not specify `runtimeVersion`, `packageUris`, `framework`, `pythonVersion`, or `predictionClass`.
	pub container: Option<GoogleCloudMlV1__ContainerSpec>,
	/// Manually select the number of nodes to use for serving the model. You should generally use `auto_scaling` with an appropriate `min_nodes` instead, but this option is available if you want more predictable billing. Beware that latency and error rates will increase if the traffic exceeds that capability of the system to serve it based on the selected number of nodes.
	pub manual_scaling: Option<GoogleCloudMlV1__ManualScaling>,
	/// Optional. One or more labels that you can add, to organize your model versions. Each label is a key-value pair, where both the key and the value are arbitrary strings that you supply. For more information, see the documentation on using labels.
	pub labels: Option<HashMap<String, String>>,
	/// Required. The AI Platform runtime version to use for this deployment. For more information, see the [runtime version list](/ml-engine/docs/runtime-version-list) and [how to manage runtime versions](/ml-engine/docs/versioning).
	pub runtime_version: String,
	/// Automatically scale the number of nodes used to serve the model in response to increases and decreases in traffic. Care should be taken to ramp up traffic according to the model's ability to scale or you will start seeing increases in latency and 429 response codes.

	/// The Cloud Storage URI of a directory containing trained model artifacts to be used to create the model version. See the [guide to deploying models](/ai-platform/prediction/docs/deploying-models) for more information. The total number of files under this directory must not exceed 1000. During projects.models.versions.create, AI Platform Prediction copies all files from the specified directory to a location managed by the service. From then on, AI Platform Prediction uses these copies of the model artifacts to serve predictions, not the original files in Cloud Storage, so this location is useful only as a historical record. If you specify container, then this field is optional. Otherwise, it is required. Learn [how to use this field with a custom container](/ai-platform/prediction/docs/custom-container-requirements#artifacts).
	pub deployment_uri: Option<String>,
	/// Output only. If true, this version will be used to handle prediction requests that do not specify a version. You can change the default version by calling projects.methods.versions.setDefault.
